<h2>These are my classes this semester</h2>

	<p>I take five classes this semester. I am an English major in Literature and Language so I take three english classes and two electives. Most of my classes are Tuesday, Thursday sections which, is not ideal but, I don't have to wake up early so that's cool. </p>

<h3>I am interested in...</h3>
		<p>I used to play lacrosse in high school and it's one of my passions but unfortunately I did not make the club team here :(. I am in a soroity called Delta Gamma and I have met a myriad of interesting women. My favorite pastime would probably have to be hanging out with my friends because I am a very sociable invdividual. </p>

<h3>My spirit animal would have to be</h3>
		<p> Over winter break I visited a zoo in California where I had the opportunity to ride a camel. So I would have to say my spirit animal is a camel because they are literally awesome. They can hold over a ton of their body weight and have humps for storing water which, is legendary. </p>
